<p>
I created this application as a side project while working as a photo assistant at a large commercial photography studio. During that time, equipment logging or tracking in the studio was an imperfect science.  </p>


<h4> The Problem </h4>
<p> 
 Logs about serial numbers were kept in excel spreadsheets. Using this type of system made it difficult for whomever was managing the inventory to quickly understand which pieces of equipment were breaking on a consistant basis, and how often those repairs were required. 
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project was to create a simple interface for those manging inventory to track serial numbers, repair instances, the location of equipment throughout the building, and purchase information.
