    <secton class="xs-px-4 xs-py-4 xs-span11 xs-mb-5 lg-span11 lg-push1 small-width ">
<p>
I created this application as a side project while working as a photo assistant at a large commercial photography studio. During that time, equipment logging or tracking in the studio was an imperfect science.  </p>


<h3 class="xs-mt-4"> The Problem </h4>
<p> 
 Logs about serial numbers were kept in excel spreadsheets. Using this type of system made it difficult for whomever was managing the inventory to quickly understand which pieces of equipment were breaking on a consistant basis, and how often those repairs were required. 
</p>


<h3 class="xs-mt-4"> Project Goals </h4>
<p>
The goal of this project was to create a simple interface for those manging inventory to track serial numbers, repair instances, the location of equipment throughout the building, and purchase information. 
</p>

<h3 class="xs-mt-4"> Process and Outcomes </h4>
<p>
Prior to this project, I had never developed a desktop application before. Part of the goal of this project was to gain an understanding of the objective-c language and how MVC models work. I went through several iterations of this project, creating prototypes in code to test my understanding. The design itself of the project relies only on UIKit components. This allowed me to let visual design take a back seat to interaction design. I conciously made this decision early in the process so that I could focus on how this appplication could actually help a user's organization.</p>

<p>
While there were technical limitations due to my inexperience that prevented me from developing a design with all the functionality I had hoped for this application, creating it was an extremely valuable exercise for me to empathize with developers and gain insight into the development process. </p>

<p>
This project taught me that done is better than perfect. I spent months redoing and redoing prototypes in an attempt to get things working exactly how I wanted them, but the further I went along, the more important it was for me to get this application out into a working enviornment and get immediate feedback from real users. Users loved the simplicity of the design, but were quick to point out a few errors both in development and design that were causing users to make critical mistakes as they started to use the program. A few quick fixes were deployed and critical errors stopped, but they should have never happened in the first place. This was an awakening early in my design career to involve end users early and often. </p>

<p>
Though this application has been discontinued due to shifting business needs, I would still love to revisit this project in the future and explore new iterations. </p>
