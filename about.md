<p class="s-pb4">
I'm concerned with not just how to do something, but why to do it. I like collaborative environments built on transparency and mentorship. I design with data whenever possible. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make more scalable, lightweight, modular design systems. 
</p>

<p class="s-pb4">
I attended art school in Columbus, Ohio where I studied design and photography. I've gotten a chance to work with companies like Nordstrom, Nationwide Insurance, Woodford Reserve, and Bed Bath and Beyond. Now I work for Curalate where I help make visual commerce better for marketers. Before that, I worked for PitchBook Data building business products for the private equity and venture capital market.

Outside of work you can find me reading or writing fiction, learning to code, or exploring the Pacific Northwest with my wife.  If you'd like to get in touch, please send me an email. If you're in Seattle, let's meet up for coffee.

<h3> About this Site </h3>
<p class="fs2 lh-body s-measure-s m-measure-m s-pb4">
	This site was designed and developed by myself with HTML and SCSS, and <a href="http://www.modularscale.com/" class="link linku"> Modular Scale</a> + <a href="http://type-scale.com/" class="link linku"> Type Scale</a>. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://github.com/basscss/basscss" alt="BassCSS Github" class="link linku"> BassCSS</a>, I took to writing atomic, functional CSS classes for most of the site. This let's me make changes quickly. I used <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" alt="Gulp" class="link linku"> Gulp</a>  to manage precompiling and minification. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" alt="Jekyll" class="link linku"> Jekyll</a> runs the templating engine. Everything is hosted on a virtual server with <a href="http://digitalocean.com/" alt="Digital Ocean" class="link linku"> Digital Ocean</a>  and version controlled with <a href="http://git-scm.com/" alt="Git" class="link linku"> Git</a> This site uses system fonts.
