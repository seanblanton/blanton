<div class="xs-mb-5">
	<p>
	I'm concerned with not just how to do something, but why to do it. I like collaborative enviornments built on transparency and mentorship. And I design with data whenever possible.
	</p>

	<p>
	I attended art school in Columbus, Ohio where I studied traditional design and photography. I've gotten a chance to work with companies like Nordstrom, Nationwide Insurance, and Bed Bath and Beyond. Now I work for PitchBook Data where we help build business products for the private equity market.

	Outside of work you can find me reading or writing fiction or exploring the Pacific Northwest with my wife. If you'd like to get in touch, please send me an email. If you're in Seattle, let's meet up for coffee.

<h2> About this Site </h2>
<p>
	This site was designed and developed by myself with HTML5, Sass, and a little bit of JQuery. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://github.com/basscss/basscss" alt="BassCSS Github" class="u"> BassCSS</a>, I took to writing atomic, immutable CSS classes. This let's me make changes quickly. The grid system is built off of <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/" alt="Susy" class="u"> Susy</a>. I used <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" alt="GruntJS" class="u"> Grunt</a>  to manage precompiling and minification. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" alt="Jekyll" class="u"> Jekyll</a> runs the templating engine. Everything is hosted on a virtual server with <a href="http://digitalocean.com/" alt="Digital Ocean" class="u"> Digital Ocean</a>  and version controlled with <a href="http://git-scm.com/" alt="Git" class="u"> Git</a> .
