	<p>
	I'm concerned with not just how to do something, but why to do it. I like collaborative environments built on transparency and mentorship. I design with data whenever possible. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make more scalable, lightweight, modular design systems. 
	</p>

	<p>
	I attended art school in Columbus, Ohio where I studied design and photography. I've gotten a chance to work with companies like Nordstrom, Nationwide Insurance, Woodford Reserve, and Bed Bath and Beyond. Now I work for PitchBook Data where I work with an amazing team to build business products for the private equity and venture capital market.

	Outside of work you can find me reading or writing fiction, learning to code, or exploring the Pacific Northwest with my wife.  If you'd like to get in touch, please send me an email. If you're in Seattle, let's meet up for coffee.

<h2> About this Site </h2>
<p>
	This site was designed and developed by myself with HTML and SCSS, and <a href="http://www.modularscale.com/" class="u"> Modular Scale</a> + <a href="http://type-scale.com/" class="u"> Type Scale</a>. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://github.com/basscss/basscss" alt="BassCSS Github" class="u"> BassCSS</a>, I took to writing atomic, functional CSS classes for most of the site. This let's me make changes quickly. The grid system is built off of <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/" alt="Susy" class="u"> Susy</a> with some  <a href="https://github.com/seanblanton/susybricks" alt="Susy Bricks" class="u">extensions</a> I built to make it more functional than it is out of the box. I used <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" alt="GruntJS" class="u"> Grunt</a>  to manage precompiling and minification. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" alt="Jekyll" class="u"> Jekyll</a> runs the templating engine. Everything is hosted on a virtual server with <a href="http://digitalocean.com/" alt="Digital Ocean" class="u"> Digital Ocean</a>  and version controlled with <a href="http://git-scm.com/" alt="Git" class="u"> Git</a> The font used throughout the site is <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/28749913/HK-Grotesk-Open-Source-Typeface" alt="HK Grotesk" class="u">HK Grotesk</a> by <a href="http://alfredomarcopradil.com/" alt="Alfredo Marco Pradil website" class="u">Alfredo Marco Pradil</a>.
