I'm concerned with not just how to do something, but why to do it. I like collaborative environments built on transparency and mentorship. I design with data whenever possible. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make more scalable, lightweight, modular design systems. 

I attended art school in Columbus, Ohio where I studied design and photography. I've gotten a chance to work with companies like Nordstrom, Nationwide Insurance, Woodford Reserve, and Bed Bath and Beyond. Now I work for Curalate where I help make visual commerce better for marketers. Before that, I worked for PitchBook Data building business products for the private equity and venture capital market.


Outside of work you can find me reading or writing fiction, learning to code, or exploring the Pacific Northwest with my wife.  If you'd like to get in touch, please send me an email. If you're in Seattle, let's meet up for coffee.
