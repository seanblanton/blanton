title: "Using System Fonts"
---
When choosing fonts for web typography, it's easy for a designer to impulsively reach for Open Sans or Lato or Avenir or whatever the newest, hottest thing out there  at the time is. I've done it. We all have. There's a compulsion for the fonts we use on the web to match the fonts we use in marketing material, particuarily print. After all - we do want to be *on brand*, right? But is that the most important thing typography should address? 

But if you start to consider your performance budget, using webfonts starts to make less and less sense. [Users hate slow websites](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2010/09/07/429014/200875/en/New-Survey-From-Compuware-Gomez-Reveals-Consumers-Will-Quickly-Abandon-Slow-Websites.html)  

#### We need to consider what typography is <em>for</em> and what problem it aims to <em>solve</em>.
 Let's pay attention to the words we don't often even bother to look up in the dictionary. Take user *interfaces* for example:


> #### in·ter·face 
> ˈin(t)ərˌfās  
>  *noun*
>
> 1. a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc., meet and interact.  
> 2. a device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer.
>
>

#### When I design something, I aim to make every single design decision solve a problem.
Sometimes that problem is for the user, like increasing legibility or reducing cognitive load. Sometimes the problem is for the business, like increasing maintainability and scalability. So maybe that means adding constraints to the design requirements and increasing the efficiency of the system.

#### If typography in an interface exists to facilitate interaction, putting a webfont in a button or other parts of UI copy does little to advance this cause. 
But what it does do is this: make your page heavier and harder to maintain. Good web typography should be functional and performant. Everything beyond that is nice to have and should be considered an optimization on an already validated design. 

#### Using system fonts allows designers to focus more on solving problems and less on aesthetics.
They also allow your site to feel native to the platform in which a user is experiencing it.
[W3C is already considering this as a standard anyway](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jul/0169.html)

If you must include webfonts as a part of your UI, at least consider the [alternatives](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/7-alternatives-to-popular-web-typefaces-for-better-performance) that might help reduce your page to help reduce weight and load them [in the most efficient way you can.](https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver)
