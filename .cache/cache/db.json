Coyotes hunt foxes, so this decrease in the coyote population led to an increase in the fox population, which in turn increased the survival rate of other coyote prey, such as hares, rodents, and birds. The changes in these populations then altered the rate at which nuts, seeds, and insects were eaten. The changing grazing patterns of elks caused vegetation to recover.

Once everyone is split up into groups and is assigned a theme, have each group spend a while (at least an hour, but it could go for several depending on the subject matter) discussing the ","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":1,"offset":11799},"end":{"line":81,"column":500,"offset":12298},"indent":[]}},{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"causes","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":502,"offset":12300},"end":{"line":81,"column":508,"offset":12306},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":500,"offset":12298},"end":{"line":81,"column":510,"offset":12308},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" and ","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":510,"offset":12308},"end":{"line":81,"column":515,"offset":12313},"indent":[]}},{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"effects","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":517,"offset":12315},"end":{"line":81,"column":524,"offset":12322},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":515,"offset":12313},"end":{"line":81,"column":526,"offset":12324},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" of their theme through the following lenses:","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":526,"offset":12324},"end":{"line":81,"column":571,"offset":12369},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":1,"offset":11799},"end":{"line":81,"column":571,"offset":12369},"indent":[]}},{"type":"list","ordered":true,"start":1,"loose":false,"children":[{"type":"listItem","loose":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Environmental","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":6,"offset":12376},"end":{"line":83,"column":19,"offset":12389},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":4,"offset":12374},"end":{"line":83,"column":21,"offset":12391},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" - Cultural, political, socio-economic, and infrastructural drivers","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":21,"offset":12391},"end":{"line":83,"column":88,"offset":12458},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":4,"offset":12374},"end":{"line":83,"column":88,"offset":12458},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1,"offset":12371},"end":{"line":83,"column":88,"offset":12458},"indent":[]}},{"type":"listItem","loose":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Attitudinal","position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":6,"offset":12464},"end":{"line":84,"column":17,"offset":12475},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":4,"offset":12462},"end":{"line":84,"column":19,"offset":12477},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" - Beliefs, morals, values, norms, fears, and expectations","position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":19,"offset":12477},"end":{"line":84,"column":77,"offset":12535},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":4,"offset":12462},"end":{"line":84,"column":77,"offset":12535},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":1,"offset":12459},"end":{"line":84,"column":77,"offset":12535},"indent":[]}},{"type":"listItem","loose":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Behavioral","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":6,"offset":12541},"end":{"line":85,"column":16,"offset":12551},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":4,"offset":12539},"end":{"line":85,"column":18,"offset":12553},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" - Actions, policies, and processes","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":18,"offset":12553},"end":{"line":85,"column":53,"offset":12588},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":4,"offset":12539},"end":{"line":85,"column":53,"offset":12588},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":1,"offset":12536},"end":{"line":85,"column":53,"offset":12588},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1,"offset":12371},"end":{"line":85,"column":53,"offset":12588},"indent":[1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"As much as possible, these causes and effects should be informed by research, rather than hunches.

Coyotes hunt foxes, so this decrease in the coyote population led to an increase in the fox population, which in turn increased the survival rate of other coyote prey, such as hares, rodents, and birds. The changes in these populations then altered the rate at which nuts, seeds, and insects were eaten. The changing grazing patterns of elks caused vegetation to recover. The number of beavers increased and created dams, which helped protect the streams and ponds against bank erosion and provided new habitats for moose and and fish.

Once everyone is split up into groups and is assigned a theme, have each group spend a while (at least an hour, but it could go for several depending on the subject matter) discussing the ","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":1,"offset":11799},"end":{"line":81,"column":500,"offset":12298}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"causes","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":502,"offset":12300},"end":{"line":81,"column":508,"offset":12306}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":500,"offset":12298},"end":{"line":81,"column":510,"offset":12308}}},{"type":"text","value":" and ","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":510,"offset":12308},"end":{"line":81,"column":515,"offset":12313}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"effects","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":517,"offset":12315},"end":{"line":81,"column":524,"offset":12322}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":515,"offset":12313},"end":{"line":81,"column":526,"offset":12324}}},{"type":"text","value":" of their theme through the following lenses:","position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":526,"offset":12324},"end":{"line":81,"column":571,"offset":12369}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":81,"column":1,"offset":11799},"end":{"line":81,"column":571,"offset":12369}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"ol","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Environmental","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":6,"offset":12376},"end":{"line":83,"column":19,"offset":12389}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":4,"offset":12374},"end":{"line":83,"column":21,"offset":12391}}},{"type":"text","value":" - Cultural, political, socio-economic, and infrastructural drivers","position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":21,"offset":12391},"end":{"line":83,"column":88,"offset":12458}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1,"offset":12371},"end":{"line":83,"column":88,"offset":12458}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Attitudinal","position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":6,"offset":12464},"end":{"line":84,"column":17,"offset":12475}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":4,"offset":12462},"end":{"line":84,"column":19,"offset":12477}}},{"type":"text","value":" - Beliefs, morals, values, norms, fears, and expectations","position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":19,"offset":12477},"end":{"line":84,"column":77,"offset":12535}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":1,"offset":12459},"end":{"line":84,"column":77,"offset":12535}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Behavioral","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":6,"offset":12541},"end":{"line":85,"column":16,"offset":12551}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":4,"offset":12539},"end":{"line":85,"column":18,"offset":12553}}},{"type":"text","value":" - Actions, policies, and processes","position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":18,"offset":12553},"end":{"line":85,"column":53,"offset":12588}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":85,"column":1,"offset":12536},"end":{"line":85,"column":53,"offset":12588}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":83,"column":1,"offset":12371},"end":{"line":85,"column":53,"offset":12588}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As much as possible, these causes and effects should be informed by research, rather than hunches.

In the design community we talk a lot about the importance of writing. In general, it's a great thing. There's a wealth of great resources on the recommended reading for designers, and there's plenty of designers putting out great content on a regular basis, too, but much of it tends to be on usability, psychology, user research, testing, should designers code, design leadership, and other kinds of technical writing. But it's not enough.</p>\n<p>The act of reading and writing fiction requires the author to imagine a reality that is not and never will be her own. It means imagining and coming to an understanding that the people in these stories have lives and experiences equally as complex as hers, and that whoever conceived of these stories has (or had) a life and motivations that are wholly different from her own life and experiences. And when we write fiction, we're asked to create realities that are not prototypical, but specific, and then to understand the implications of those realities for the people that inhabit that imagined space. How do two people with differing value sets perceive the world differently, and how do they interact together?</p>\n<p>All fiction is a design problem, that is to say that fiction seeks to organize the world for a specific purpose. And while the world in which novelists organize and create meaning and just happens to be imagined, that imagined world is valid, and real, and informed and strengthened by the reality that surrounds it.</p>\n<p>The act of fiction goes far beyond something like writing personas. While personas tend to be constructed to be a single, concrete figure, that persona is intended to stand as proxy for an entire user group. This is the difference between <em>persona</em> and <em>character</em>. Persona is often too reductive to ever be more than a ghost of a person inside of a work of fiction. It's through a combination of persona, user journey, and storyboarding that we as designers only begin to scratch the surface of what it means to be the personas we imagine, validate, and ultimately design for. What the very best fiction does so well is examines character through the lenses of change and time. It finds nuanced differences in character's moods, behaviors, belief systems, needs, goals, etc between what was and what is. And the very best writers consider you, the reader, too. Your thoughts and your emotion and the experience of you as person sitting and reading the scene and comparing it in your mind to your entire worldview.</p>\n<p>The more we read stories and the more we try to write our own, the better a language we have to understand the people whom we design for, and the better context we have to understand ourselves.</p>\n<p>Some of the most important things I may need to convey in a design can only be really talked about anecdotally, through some metaphor, image, or story. It’s through story that my thoughts are condensed and transfigured. These stories become easier to understand or draw correlations between because we’re all so used to them. Every single one of us tells stories. Anthropologists have identified that storytelling exists in every country and every culture in the world, and stories have existed in some form or another, oral, written, or visual, for thousands of years. Our entire civilization has been built on our ability to communicate with and understand one another effectively.</p>\n<p>When I tell you a story, it's because I need to tell you something about the way I think or the way that I feel. I tell stories when something is funny, or interesting, or profound, or beautiful, or inspiring. When we tell stories we assume our telling will communicate something to the recipient about who we are and what we think and value.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Is this what I think? And is this all I have to say? And am I making myself understood?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And herein lays the key problem: the words I write can only sketch the outline of what it is I mean to say. But then I present these words as a tangible artifact of who I am and what I think.</p>\n<p>As a designer, my understanding of the person whom I design for can only ever be a sketch of who I think they might be, not who they are. It helps to practice healthy skepticism:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Health Approach presupposes that truth is objective at least in the minimal sense that believing something does not make it so, that something‘s being true does not mean we believe it, and that we are capable of making mistakes.”</p>\n<p>– (pg. 90) LE MORVAN, Pierre. \"Healthy Skepticism and Practical Wisdom\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It behooves me to be as skilled as I can be at creating such a weak representation of real life, and to be always conscious of the fact that no matter how true I believe the facts to be, it’s always possible that I may be wrong every time. And that — that is incredibly humbling.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-0bb5eea2e89000ab391c8038d6a3479b-gatsby-remark-prismjs-","value":"<p>There’s this famous story about the wolves of Yellowstone you might have heard. Throughout the early days of Yellowstone Park, wolves were considered a nucant predator, as they were thought to be a threat to local livestock, and as a result, were not legally protected from being hunted. In 1907 political pressure from local ranchers and agricultural interests led to the USFS working with the United States Department of Agriculture Division of Biological Survey to develop methods for controlling wolves and coyotes.</p>\n<p>Between 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in the park. By 1926, grey wolves were considered to be locally extinct. And after the wolves were gone, the elk population began to rise and overgraze on aspen, cottonwood, and berry producing shrubs. The loss of these plants led to a decline in beaver populations, too, as they depend on these plants to survive in the wintertime. Scientists began to worry about the negative effect as early as the 1930s.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s (but as far back as the 1940s) wildlife biologists began to call for reintroducing wolves to the park, and finally, in March of 1995, fourteen wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone. The resulting change has been magnificent. In the years that followed, not only have the elk populations decreased, but the coyote population has too. Coyotes hunt foxes, so this decrease in the coyote population led to an increase in the fox population, which in turn increased the survival rate of other coyote prey, such as hares, rodents, and birds. The changes in these populations then altered the rate at which nuts, seeds, and insects were eaten. The changing grazing patterns of elks caused vegetation to recover. The number of beavers increased and created dams, which helped protect the streams and ponds against bank erosion and provided new habitats for moose and and fish. The songbirds came back.</p>\n<p>Ecologists call this a “trophic cascade”. It’s a phenomenon where the act of adding or removing a top predator from the food chain causes a dramatic change in the food chain of the ecosystem as a whole. At Yellowstone, the reintroduction of a top predator caused the entire watershed to become not just more ecologically diverse, but more stable, too.</p>\n<p>The ecosystem that drives Yellowstone is a complex set of cascading actions and their consequences. This cascading effect exists far outside of ecology though. A change in just one aspect of any complex system can have an outsized effect on the whole. And the more we understand this chain of cause and effect, the better equipped we are to make decisions about how to change it for the better.</p>\n<p>About a year ago I wrote an overview of system dynamics and its application on design systems, largely based on the work of Donella Meadows. Today I’d like to build on that work by discussing how you can model systems to help you understand where you need to focus to have the most impact. Much of the concepts and ideas I’ll outline in this system + design workshop format are inspired by Rob Ricigliano.</p>\n<h2>Who Is This For?</h2>\n<p>Systems thinking is a hot topic in product design right now, but let’s be very clear: not every problem can be solved with a system frame of mind. Problems that are well defined, well scoped, and focus on short-term progress probably won’t benefit from the kind of concentrated analysis that systems practices require to be executed successfully. Those types of problems are excellent for classic design sprints. I won’t go into detail about that here, but there’s a wealth of knowledge out there about design sprints. I recommend GV’s book Sprint.</p>\n<p>Systems practice is better suited for folks looking to make significant change on a broad scale. This is because systems practice aims to make sustainable change through identifying the underlying social, behavioral, and environmental factors driving them.</p>\n<p>By their very nature, systems are wildly complex things, and solving issues in systems means bringing experts under the same roof. Often these folks don’t get enough opportunities to solve problems collaboratively. Systems mapping will help bring these subject matter experts together so we can get a broad overview of the system and look for integrated ways to improve the health of the system and make more progress than we otherwise would have if we had acted in isolation.</p>\n<h2>Who to Involve?</h2>\n<p>If you’re going to run a workshop to map a system, you’ll need to build up a team in a few layers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Core Team —</strong> These folks are a small group of people to organize and drive the workshop itself. They need the most understanding of systems practice to help string together the group's thoughts into a coherent system. If you’re reading this, that’s probably you.</li>\n<li><strong>System Stakeholders —</strong> These are subject matter experts from the community that can help inform and educate the group on the inner workings of the system.</li>\n<li><strong>Participants —</strong> These are folks involved in key activities throughout the workshop, but aren’t responsible for any of the deliverables. They’re great to include when you need to get more detailed on a specific part of a system. Think of these folks as people who can help you collect the most robust data set possible to map your system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Work Backwards from a North Star</h2>\n<p>Before you start diving into mapping your system and identifying areas of opportunity, it’s a good idea to think <strong>upfront</strong> about the outcomes you really care about. You likely won’t be able to solve all your problems at once, but knowing your ultimate goals can direct your short term focus to be in service of that larger term goal. Think about this with your Core Team and come up with a succinct statement to represent what you’re actually driving toward. This is often called a North Star vision.</p>\n<p>Your North Star should have a few qualities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It should be inspiring.</strong> Often, this north star is the root of your story. You’ll use it to tell others about the work you’re doing and why it’s important. It will seem far off, and others may think it’s unachievable, but it should also be a future everyone’s eager to get to. In my opinion, this is the most important part of any long term strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>It should be human-centered.</strong> Now is not the time to worry about metrics. These aspirational north stars are more about identifying what a healthy, sustainable system looks like. Metrics can come later as a way to measure your progress along the way.</li>\n<li><strong>It should be long term.</strong> These types of visions can take years, if not decades to achieve. This positions them as a guiding light, but also allows them to be malleable over time as conditions change.</li>\n<li><strong>It should be aware of its surroundings.</strong> When you’re developing this North Star statement with your team, think about the larger challenges you expect your organization to face over the coming years, as well as other goals you may be trying to achieve. Your industry may be evolving dramatically over the next few years, and there may already be signs of that change happening today that can inform this long term vision.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Along the way, you may develop other milestones that represent significant progress toward this ultimate outcome. Those milestones should still take years to get to - but should give you a better picture about how to reach that end state. Sometimes, these nearer term milestones can be more helpful to focus on for systems mapping workshops because they’re easier to attach the current reality of the system to. If you focus too much on a moonshot, people may not be able to connect it to the problems you’re already facing today.</p>\n<h2>Don’t Boil the Ocean</h2>\n<p>Often, when you start mapping a system, you’ll identify a lot of different areas you could <em>potentially</em> focus on improving. But it might not be immediately clear which one is most <em>important</em> to focus on first. It can feel overwhelming or discouraging, but it’s important to not boil the ocean. Without a focal point, workshops can go off the rails pretty quickly. It’s important to <strong>establish a single clear and specific question that can serve as the theme for the workshop</strong> before it starts.</p>\n<p>In design sprints, it’s common to spend most of the time focusing on coming up with <strong>solutions</strong> to a problem. In a system mapping workshop, we want to <strong>avoid specific solutions</strong> and instead spend the majority of the time seeking to <strong>understand how the system works</strong>. Focusing too prematurely on solutions causes us to fall back on the knowledge that’s most readily available, rather than looking for the areas where we have the greatest leverage. <strong>How Might We and Jobs To Be Done exercises put your systems mapping workshop at risk</strong> of going off the rails.</p>\n<p>As you’re developing the theme for your workshop, instead of asking “How?”, which is about developing <em>solutions</em>, shift the conversation toward asking “What?” — more specifically “What accounts for…?” which sets up the workshop to be centered around uncovering <strong>factors</strong> and <strong>relationships</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Theme:</strong></p>\n<p>“What factors account for the current rates of CO2 emissions in the United States?”</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Lightning Talks</h2>\n<p>Before you really dive into the workshop, you may start with a series of <strong>lightning talks</strong> from key stakeholders. This is where I’d recommend starting if you have a diverse pool of specialists who may be less familiar with the overall subject matter. These lightning talks are usually 10-20 minute talks that give a high level overview of a particular problem space. Remember:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>These are purely informational and aren’t intended to present any solutions at all — they’re just there to get everyone in the room up to the same basic level of knowledge so conversations can happen more easily.</li>\n<li>If you decide to do lightning talks, give presenters ample time to prepare (at least a week. Opt for more if you can).</li>\n<li>Give folks coffee and bathroom breaks every ~45 minutes so everyone stays focused throughout all the talks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 2: Define the Factors</h2>\n<p>The first step in mapping a system is to understand all the factors that impact the system as it stands today. You’ll want all the stakeholders and participants present for this exercise. This exercise helps everyone get their thoughts out to the rest of the group early on, and it lets people focus on the areas they already have knowledge of without asking anyone to come up with solutions yet. You’ll use affinity mapping to find commonality among these factors. This type of exercise should feel really familiar to anyone who is used to running post it exercises as a part of design sprints. To run this exercise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take 10 minutes and have everyone write down all the factors they can think of that impact the system on sticky notes.</li>\n<li>Use two colors of sticky notes - one for factors that <strong>help</strong> the system and another color for factors that <strong>hurt</strong> the system.</li>\n<li>These help/hurt factors should map back to your original defining statement and focus on factors that can push the system into a <strong>healthy</strong> state or an <strong>unhealthy</strong> one.</li>\n<li>After the 10 minutes is up, go around the room and have everyone share their factors. Put each sticky up on the board in two groups.</li>\n<li>The facilitators should help group similar ideas or duplicates together as folks are sharing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 3: Look for Cause and Effect</h2>\n<p>After you have a wide array of factors listed out on the whiteboard and a rough idea of the themes that they fit into, it’s time to start digging deeper into each theme<strong>. We want to start to form a story about the relationships between these factors</strong>, and the best way to start that is by looking at their upstream and downstream effects.</p>\n<p>This section of the workshop can take quite a while to do. To speed things up, break up the workshop into smaller groups. It’s good to have a mixture of subject matter experts in each group to keep the conversation going - but try to keep it to 3-5 people in each group. Assign each group a theme to work with. Once everyone is split up into groups and is assigned a theme, have each group spend a while (at least an hour, but it could go for several depending on the subject matter) discussing the <strong>causes</strong> and <strong>effects</strong> of their theme through the following lenses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Environmental</strong> - Cultural, political, socio-economic, and infrastructural drivers</li>\n<li><strong>Attitudinal</strong> - Beliefs, morals, values, norms, fears, and expectations</li>\n<li><strong>Behavioral</strong> - Actions, policies, and processes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As much as possible, these causes and effects should be informed by research, rather than hunches. It’s okay to draw on the subject matter of the experts in the room, but the more validation you have about these relationships, the more sound and secure your system map will be when it’s done, and the easier it will be to measure changes over time.</p>\n<p>Remember that the causes and effects for these factors can be both physical and nonphysical. Let’s look at our example framing sentence of CO2 emissions in the US. Factors making CO2 emissions worse may be cars, freight, air travel, etc.</p>\n<p>If we think about causes and effects, we can think about the physical, environmental distance between where the average American works and lives, or we can think about the attitudinal value set around individualism or vehicle ownership as a status symbol. The more likely someone is to value their individualism and freedom, the more likely they may be to own their own car and drive it. The more they drive, the larger their carbon footprint is.</p>\n<p>As everyone works to map causes and effects, remember to take breaks in between to keep everyone engaged. After the time is up, have each team go around the room and spend 10 minutes explaining the causes and effects they identified. Note any areas where there may be overlapping factors starting to emerge.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Create Feedback Loops</h2>\n<p>With a strong understanding of the causes and effects for each of the themes, we can start identifying <strong>feedback loops</strong>. These feedback loops can help us start to understand why this system behaves the way that it does, and forms the skeleton of a system map. These loops are often called <strong>Causal Loop Diagrams</strong> in systems practice.</p>\n<p>Start by picking a single factor from the most robust theme you have outlined and listing out what causes that factor. Write each of them on post it notes and stick them on the whiteboard. These causes should be informed by the previous exercise. Continue asking what causes that factor, and what causes that, and so on until you’ve looped back to the original factor. Draw arrows on a whiteboard between each factor and note how the upstream and downstream factors affect each other. Use + and - symbols to denote how these factors are changing. As you create your loops, consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each step in the loop, name each factor with a simple phrase, but try to keep it a noun that doesn’t specify amounts. Going back to our example, if you identified the number of cars on the road and the length of time people were commuting to work, rather than writing “longer commute” just write “commute time” with “+” at both ends of the arrow to denote that as more cars are on the road, the average commute time goes up.</li>\n<li>I’ve found that it’s more helpful to think about whether you’re trying to create loops to demonstrate healthy behaviors or unhealthy behaviors. It can be difficult for both loops to coexist in the same system diagram without confusing people. <strong>Decide as a group</strong> before you start creating your loops <strong>if you’d like to focus on what factors contribute to an increasingly healthier system or an increasingly unhealthier one</strong>.</li>\n<li>That being said, focusing on only health or unhealthy loops can make it hard to discuss some issues naturally. Try to stick to one pattern, but don’t force it.</li>\n<li>Note along the way if there are gaps in your knowledge that prevent you from completing a loop. This may be a good place to dig in with other participants later.</li>\n<li><strong>Every loop should tell an important story about how your system works.</strong> As you’re building your loops, consider building out more specific narratives that can ground these loops in realistic scenarios. These can become powerful ways to get others to connect with the system.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 5: Classify Your Loops</h2>\n<p>Each loop you’ve created can now be labeled. There are a few common classifications of loops:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Vicious</strong> - A <em>reinforcing</em> loop that make things get worse and worse over time</li>\n<li><strong>Virtuous</strong> - A <em>reinforcing</em> loop that gets better and better over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Stabilizing</strong> - A type of self-correcting (<em>balancing</em>) loop that keeps things from getting worse</li>\n<li><strong>Stagnating</strong> - A type of self-correcting (<em>balancing</em>) loop that keeps things from getting better</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In general, reinforcing loops are associated with exponential change, while balancing loops are associated with plateaus. For a system to remain healthy we tend to need a mixture of both of them, but more often than not the loops we have in the current system exist in the wrong proportion, which leads to an unstable system.</p>\n<p>After everyone has finished sharing their loops, the collaborative portion of the workshop is finished. It’s a good idea to inform others about what the next steps will be and when you’ll be following up with them, as they won’t be a part of the next stage.</p>\n<h2>Step 6: Build the Map</h2>\n<p>At this point, it should just be the core group of folks who organized the original work. Now that you have some well established loops, <strong>start grouping and looking for relationships that connect your loops together.</strong> These loops should represent the core narrative for how your system works, but they should also branch off into other, smaller causal loops. This is the starting point for your overall system map.</p>\n<p>Depending on what the dominant story is you’d like to tell about this system, and your original anchoring statement, you may need to experiment with a few different arrangements for your map. You might need to add new loops to fill out a narrative about how two existing loops connect.</p>\n<p>This is the point at which you’ll start to find a lot of new connection points that might not have been addressed earlier. Some things I’ve found helpful at this stage are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don’t feel the need to keep every part of the diagram.</strong> If there is a factor that isn’t part of a loop, it might not be an important part of the story. Focus on the areas that best address your original framing statement.</li>\n<li><strong>Write out conclusions as you discover them</strong>. As you start to draw new connections, write out a narrative for them so you can keep track of them. As the map gets more interconnected, some of those stories can easily get lost or forgotten. Having the stories helps you understand which parts of the map are most important and which are less important.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Socializing &#x26; Iterate on the Map</h2>\n<p>Once you have your initial map, it’s time to start socializing it with others who participated in the original workshop.. Now is the time to invite everyone back together and explain what you’ve been doing, how you’ve been doing it, and what your key findings are so far. The goal here is to <strong>act transparently and to seek feedback from others</strong>. At this stage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Remember that this is just the initial map.</strong> People are going to have opinions and the map is going to need refining.</li>\n<li><strong>Remind everyone of the original anchoring question.</strong> Otherwise you may get feedback about issues in the system that may be valid, but are out of scope for what you’re trying to identify and affect.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on the most important story.</strong> You’ve likely come up with several narratives throughout the process of building this map. Focus the initial feedback so you can walk away with clear action items to improve upon it.</li>\n<li><strong>Save your iterations.</strong> Once you’ve shared your map and gathered feedback, you’ll likely need to make some adjustments to your map. Make sure to save a copy of the original map. Being able to show the evolution of the map is an important part of your narrative that can help stakeholders understand your thinking over time!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 7: Look for Opportunity</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve run through a few rounds of feedback, you should have a map that solidly speaks to your anchoring question. It should thoroughly explain the underlying causes and effects that lead to a healthy or unhealthy system, and you should have a few narratives to ground your map in reality.</p>\n<p>Now is the time to look at the current state of the system and ask yourself what aspects of the system are preventing it from reaching the north star you’d ultimately like to get to? With the system printed out (now is a great time to utilize a plotter, if you have one) have everyone spend some time examining it and writing down problem statements. Your problem statement should acknowledge the current situation and also the north star you’d like to get to.</p>\n<p>From here you can focus on identifying where you have the most leverage: where can you exert a small amount of force and have an outsized impact on the system itself? Is there anywhere where a small action can cause an entire watershed in your system to reshape? Think about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where are loops working against each other?</li>\n<li>Where are there long delays in feedback loops that make undesirable behaviors even worse?</li>\n<li>Where are there loops that are dominating other aspects of the system, even if they’re undesirable?</li>\n<li>Is there anywhere where stagnation is preventing the system from moving forward?</li>\n<li>Where are you seeing strong downstream effects on the rest of the system? Are those areas positive and ripe for reinforcement, or negative, and ripe for disruption?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These statements can become the seeds for How Might We statements that can drive future design proposals for change. As you iterate through these HMW statements, use the strong narratives about the system that you’ve already created to tell a story about how things are today and how you expect them to change in the future.</p>\n<p>By thinking about design solutions as not just features you could push, but in terms of <strong>people, products, and processes as all playing an equal role in the solution</strong>, you can start to affect the system through the same environmental, behavioral, and attitudinal lenses we examined earlier. And you can also use your map of the system to check your proposals for any potentially unforeseen downstream effects on other loops in the system.</p>\n<h2>Implementing Strategies</h2>\n<p>As you start to narrow your opportunities down to the ones that are the most viable, think about which options can have a multiplicative effect on the system. You may be able to combine two or three smaller ideas that can build on top of each other to be greater than the sum of their parts. Pay careful attention to what kind of data instrumentation you’ll need to put in place to determine early on if your assumptions are correct. By identifying these before you ever act, you can also understand what baselines you need to establish and if the correct instrumentation is in place for those.</p>\n<p>Once you settle on a solution, draw the strategy out onto your system map so you can explain to others what effect you expect the changes to have. You can highlight specific strategies by graying back the rest of the visualization so it’s clear and easy to see exactly where the changes are being introduced.</p>\n<h2>Adapt and Learn</h2>\n<p>As you implement your strategies and start to collect more data about how the system responds, you’ll start to understand more about how the system works. You’ll need to make continual adjustments along the way. It’s helpful to document the journey and assess every now and then whether the system is changing in ways you expect. Remember, systems are always changing, which means the work on them is never done. The goal should never be to “fix a problem” - but rather to establish a direction and continually work to improve the system’s overall health and sustainability over time.</p>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/wildlife/keystone-species-zm0z11zrog#ixzz1clbGyAwq\">Keystone Species: How Predators Create Abundance and Stability</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557\">Thinking in Systems - A Primer</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-fa285e9bf908752673073cec5e3ccb82-gatsby-remark-prismjs-","value":"<p>Coming up with a consistant set of colors for us in UI design is no easy task.

Likewise, some hues may need to be adjusted as saturation increases to keep them optically consistent.</p>\n<p>I found myself wanting the flexibility to pull or push hues around quickly, and I wanted the results to be something that could be quickly translated to code so that the single source of truth could live with the developers, rather than a sketch file designers would have to export and transmit back and forth.</p>\n<p>I tried some existing tools created by <a href=\"http://www.jxnblk.com/\">Brent Jackson</a>, namely <a href=\"https://palx.jxnblk.com/\">Palx</a>, which served as a huge inspiration for this project. However, it didn't have the flexibility to adjust hue or saturation. I built Palettes using the same tool as Palx,  <a href=\"http://gka.github.io/chroma.js/\">Chroma JS</a>, but retooling it to have increased flexibility. This little library works wonders.</p>\n<h2>Palettes</h2>\n<p>Here's a peek at Palettes:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">stepsToFloat</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> options <span class=\"token operator\">=></span>\n  Array<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">from</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> length<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> options<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>luminance <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>n<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> i<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>i <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">0.5</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">reverse</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>s <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">modulate</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>s<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>options<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>start<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> options<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>end<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This is the first piece.

By picking colors manually and plotting them on a curve, I found I was consistanty adjusting saturation on a roughly logarithmic curve. Hue shifts were adjusted on a quadradic curve. This takes a starting color, a step in the scale, an index, and a level of saturation or hue shift. Positive numbers shift hue right on the standard <code class=\"language-text\">CIECAM02</code> model. Negative numbers shift the hue left.</p>\n<p>Then I needed to adjust each color based on it's starting point, changing hue and saturation as those parameters existed:</p>\n<div

The following builds on the work of others that have come before me but is more like a kind of framework or position. It’s yet to be proven whether or not this framework supports the needs of an evolving and expanding ecosystem of platforms and media. I’ve done my best to allow this work to be applicable in any content or platform without being prescriptive in its application.</p>\n<h2>Design systems are not visual</h2>\n<p>The noun “design system” itself comes with a whole lot of baggage — and unfortunately most of that baggage involves the perception of a design system as a collection of drawn stuff your design team made. As designers, engineers, and product managers alike all know is that the Design Artifact (DA) is only the tip of the iceberg and tends to be one of the last decisions made in the product development cycle, long after all the other work has been done to determine just exactly what the DA needs to be in the first place.</p>\n<p>Example: One need not draw any kind of dropdown selector until the fact has already been established that a user needs to be able to make a selection in the first place and that the selection can be one (or sometimes n) number of possible options, that a selector is the most appropriate way in which to present this information, that the selector is something appropriate for this context, that the users of this product know and understand what a selector is and how to use it, ad almost infinitum.</p>\n<p>And even after selector is the proposed DA for this design problem, we need a rigorous way in which to describe that entity that doesn’t leave out or misrepresent horribly some situation that we hadn’t accounted for, or some new platform of media that sends the entire Jenga tower crashing and tumbling down in some awful mess and we’re sitting there around a conference room table recoiled in terror wondering if we’d even ever designed anything at all.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that design systems aren’t visual in the first place — it’s just that that’s one of the easiest ways for someone to latch on to what a design system is for. Design systems are an abstract way to talk about the real things we make in the world. In this way, they function more like mathematical entities than physical objects. DS investigates the conceptions of and relationships between entities which comprise designed artifacts.</p>\n<p>Let’s go through an example of how design systems are like mathematics. Take the number $$3$$. How does one define the number $$3$$? Most of us would point to an instance of $$3$$ of something: three books on the table; three fingers held up. But this kind of definition doesn’t tell us anything about the relationship between three as a count of books on the table and, say, the relationship between three angles in a triangle, or the square root of 3 much less. We’ll need a definition of $$3$$ that isn’t bound by any thing before we can even begin to discuss what three can do without clutching our heads in frustration. The same is true for entities in a design system. For us to have any kind of rigorous account of what that system is to keep the Jenga tower standing tall, we need to separate from it any kind of specific implementation or application. To wit: What is the ontological status of a design system?</p>\n<p>[[ define intro to fundamental forces… how to build up the particle set and put back together ]]</p>\n<h2>Fundamental Forces of Design Systems</h2>\n<p>Before we get into describing design system structure and interactions, it’s important to be apprised that there’s a whole slew of things that can influence the types of inputs we pass to any design system structure. We can stack these forces together and use them to evaluate our design system for any given situation.</p>\n<p>Let’s take typography as an example: say we’d like to determine an appropriate set of type sizes for our design system. Those type sizes can be represented as a finite set of numbers T. To determine what set of sizes might be appropriate, we can consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The context in which a user experiences the design system (web or mobile, for instance) may give us insight into our initial value for $$f_{0}$$ or the total number of values $$n$$ the system needs to support</li>\n<li>Internationalization may give information about a preferred minimum font size needed to render content with non-Western characters</li>\n<li>Brand may give insight into how subtle or extreme the ratio $$r$$ between each value in the set is or the initial size to base the system off of</li>\n<li>The returned value may be further adjusted given more context like user settings or environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>$$baseValue = f<em>{0} = f + brand + context$$\n$$minimumSize = m = m + brand + internationalization$$\n$$maximumSize = lim</em>{m \\to \\infty} = M + brand + context$$\n$$length = n + context$$\n$$ratio = r = 1 * brand$$</p>\n<p>$$T = \\forall f \\in {...,f<em>{0},...} f</em>{0}r^\\tfrac{f}{M} * context$$</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>☝ This notation is probably wildly off… better triple check this before ever posting</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The influence of these fundamental forces can be as small as determining font size and as large as determining which features to enable in a certain locale or on a certain device. A non-exhaustive list of possible fundamental forces includes:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>External Standards</th>\n<th>W3C, WCAG, and other best practice consortiums who promote interoperability on the web</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Context</td>\n<td>External factors the system has no control over. e.g. Brightness, time, user activity, user settings, impairment, etc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Research</td>\n<td>The results of user testing, competitor research, A/B testing, etc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Internationalization</td>\n<td>Translations, cultural alternatives, RTL layouts, etc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brand</td>\n<td>Brand values, voice, position, target audience, etc which may anchor design decisions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Parts of a Design System</h2>\n<p>Context (Context Functions)\nContexts are external factors outside the design system that the system has no control over. When context comes into a design system, the system needs to adapt to fit that context. Because of this, every element of a design system is a function of $$N$$ contexts, each represented as</p>\n<p>$$C(x) = context(particle)$$</p>\n<h4>Force</h4>\n<p>To have force is to to an effect on the output of an aspect of the design system. Design systems are affected by fundamental forces (described above)</p>\n<h4>Particles</h4>\n<p>Particles are sets containing a single entity. They are informed by fundamental forces but are themselves immutable parts of the design system. Particles are typed and are agnostic of any implementation. The known types are: <code class=\"language-text\">number</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">string</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">boolean</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">function</code></p>\n<h4>Equivalent Particle Subsets</h4>\n<p>Particle sets are the subset of all particles which, given particles $$a, b$$, and context $$C$$, are equivalent. Particle sets may be of different types, e.g. a numeral and a string, but still return the same value under the same context. E.g. color transformations.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">C(a) == C(b)</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// context.platform = 'ios'</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">C</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>val<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">toIosColor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>val<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">C</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'#FFF'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token constant\">C</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">rgb</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">255</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">255</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">255</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// TRUE</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Particle Arrays</h4>\n<p>Particle arrays are subsets of particles which all have the same type and are interchangeable. They are context agnostic and provide the foundation for variance. Particle arrays may get their values from an Equivalent Particle Subset via some Context function.</p>\n<p>Example\n<code class=\"language-text\">TypeSizes = [10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32;]</code>\n<code class=\"language-text\">Color = [r, g, b, a]</code></p>\n<h4>Atoms</h4>\n<p>An atom a set $$1+N$$ particles whose values are equal to the properties required to define a single property of a given context. These vary across platforms and are transformed by Context functions</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">width\nheight\nbackgroundColor</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Elements</h4>\n<p>Elements are the set of particles which combine to equal the minimum specification required to produce a standard tag or component in a native context.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>button <span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div <span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>NSView <span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Objects</h4>\n<p>Objects are instances of elements</p>\n<h2>Interactions of Subatomic Design Particles</h2>\n<p>Not all particles are affected by context equally. For instance, particles, particle arrays, or particle sets which have no data properties will not interact with some content strategy contexts.

The ideas I present here might be skewed and in some cases, rather abstract. This is partly because if I were to put these concepts into more concrete forms they lose a kind of universality that this article seeks to outline.</p>\n<p>I also recognize that this way of modeling systems assumes certain organizational structures exist inside a company that can support this methodology. This includes not only the mechanisms to collect data about the system behavior, but a team (or teams) with the time to dedicate toward understanding the behavior of the design, product, and engineering teams using the design system. It also assumes that these organizations are at a level of scale and complexity large enough to warrant even <strong><em>worrying</em></strong> about this type of thing. I'm not entirely convinced that the costs outweigh the benefits for smaller organizations, specifically because so much of what this article discusses is already sort of tacitly understood by at least some people in the org. But that doesn't mean there isn't something to be gained by rising the ocean of understanding across the board.</p>\n<p>This article's thrust is to outline the broad strokes of systems analysis and how it relates to design systems in a way that is helpful without having to go full boar into complex system modeling or theories that aren't immediately applicable to a design organization. While it's all very fascinating, there just isn't enough space in this article to dedicate to going into the nuance. It's my hope instead that this article inspire teams to have rigorous discussions about how their design system structure is influencing behavior, and identify ways to use design systems better to reach their goals.</p>\n<h2>Designing Design Systems</h2>\n<p><em>TLDR: Systems give us a better understanding of the how complex, interconnected, nonlinear parts behave. If we can model it, we can use it to make better decisions in the future.</em></p>\n<p>Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you already have a design system. Fabulous. As the overall complexity of that design system grows over time, it will become more and more necessary to get a better handle on exactly what the hell people are doing with it. Are your design systems actually effective at solving problems? Are you actually reaching the goals you set out to achieve? And just what are those goals, anyway? Is it to build faster and more consistently — or is that really just more of a rule or requirement you need to fulfill in order to keep the thing standing up in the first place?</p>\n<p>All of these questions are tied up in the operational complexity of whatever organization your design system aims to serve. It could be a team or 5 for an individual surface or a team of 500. It doesn't really matter - at some point it becomes difficult to make improvements to how your design system operates without having a baseline to measure from — to have some indication one way or another if your design system is trending the organization toward its larger goal. We can't predict the future, but we can envision it, and the greater understanding we have of the world in which our design system sits and the behavior of the people who act upon it, the better decisions we can make about how to structure it, communicate it, and scale it so that it provides the most value and the least stress.</p>\n<p>Once we understand how the system is structured and how it behaves, we can shift from asking questions like \"Is it okay for dialogs to be scrollable?\" and instead spending more of our time asking questions like \"What role should design systems play in improving product quality?\". These types of questions have longer lasting, broader impact than any single event or pattern of events could because they're necessarily future-oriented. The amount of <strong><em>leverage</em></strong> we can enact on the system goes up as we become more future oriented.</p>\n<p><img src=\"understanding-structure-1d80db20-8315-4a50-9584-6e8ef0fe6bbb.svg\" alt=\"Example of the structure of design systems\" title=\"Design systems structure\"></p>\n<p>Design systems are far more than the product they export. They are educational programs and support networks, bug reporting channels, experimental projects, and so on. And there are actors in that system that will do things with that design system that we might not expect. Our ability to recognize and respond to behaviors we don't expect can impact our ability to design design systems that are resilient - systems that can grow and evolve as the company, its goals, and the people who are a part of it grow and evolve.</p>\n<p>I'll be exploring these ideas through the lens of system analysis, which is a branch of systems theory. This was all highly inspired by a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557\" title=\"Thinking in Systems\">Thinking in Systems</a> from Donella Meadows. That book is an excellent crash course into systems theory. And many of the examples I'll use to explain some basic concepts of systems are pulled from that work or others like it. Not all my examples are directly related to design — and that's okay. Where possible, I will illustrate concepts by using simple systems with which we are all already familiar.</p>\n<h2>What is systems theory and how can it help design systems?</h2>\n<p>A system is a collection of <strong>interconnected</strong>, organized elements that work together to produce patterns of behavior over time. E.g. A highway is a system of roads and signs and ramps organized for the purpose of maximizing efficient travel. Systems can be embedded inside of systems, so a traffic light is a subsystem within that larger road system. The individual traffic lights go on and off in a specific order and pattern that we can model. The signal's individual behavior acts on the larger roadway and the people that use those roads. The fact that they are a system isn't the interesting part — the interesting part comes into play when we understand how those individual parts of the system work together to do something meaningful. e.g. How does the addition or subtraction of a single traffic light effect congestion? We encounter all kinds of systems on a daily basis, we just don't often think of them as such. Every person you've ever met is a system of hundreds of little tiny systems all working together to help us breathe and eat and go about our days.</p>\n<p>Systems theory is the study of how systems are structured and why they do whatever it is they do by understanding their parts, relationships, and behaviors that emerge from them. If we can model a system, we can use that model to gain another perspective that can help us identify root causes to problems and in turn make better decisions. We can expose the model to rigor. We can find the places where it breaks down or find critical relationships that aren't immediately obvious.</p>\n<p>One of the fundamental flaws with systems analysis is that a model of a system is just that - it's only a model, and that model is going to be imperfect. Often, the world in which these models live and breath is a curving set French curves of relationships that swirl and bend back on themselves in complicated ways. They are dynamic and experience perturbations we never expected and can't account for, but the better we understand a system's structure at its basic level, the more equipped we are to understand it at its most complex.</p>\n<h2>Parts of a system</h2>\n<p>Not everything is a system, mind you. That pile of junk in my filing cabinet drawer - not a system, no matter how much I might try to convince you that it's an \"<em>organized mess</em>\". There are a collection of elements, sure, but they are neither connected to one another nor are they in a state of change. Nothing acts on them and they don't cause anything else to change, either. Systems have a common set of identifiable elements we can model and a set of behaviors acting on that system. Let's get a little glossary going so we don't have to fuss with what all these things mean as we get going. If you are already familiar with systems theory, you might find some of these explanations fairly reductive, but it'll give us some common ground to work our way up from:</p>\n<h2>Stocks</h2>\n<p>Okay, so stocks are the quantifiable <em>stuff</em> of a system, the <em>inventory</em> or <em>goods (</em>though they don't need to be physical. Stock may also be things like physical energy, or patience).A stock is the bedrock of a system. Stocks in a design system might be the number of designers, engineers, and content strategists your design system is consumed by. It's the org budget, the headcount. It's also the number of people maintaining the system, the number of components, the footprint of products it supports, the amount of time available in a given week to maintain it, and so on.</p>\n<h3><strong>We tend to focus more on stocks than flows</strong></h3>\n<p>When considering design systems, we often over-index on the volume of our stocks, e.g. the number of components in the design system, for instance, and underweight the value in managing the flows that feed those systems. It's easier to make decisions based on adoption than it is to make decisions based on the rate of divergence.</p>\n<p>If we can understand what stocks exist in a design system and what flows influence those stocks, what goals we aim to reach by managing these feedback loops, and what rules govern those goals, we can start to form strategies on how to best manipulate our systems to reach those goals.</p>\n<h2>Flows</h2>\n<p>Flows are actions which cause a stock to increase or decrease over time. Flows can either be inflows, actions which cause a stock to increase, or outflows, which cause a stock to decrease. Once we have a single flow and two stocks, we have the beginning of a relationship in that system. For example: the more births there are, the more the population increases. There is an inflow relationship between births and population. But there's more going on here, too — the greater the population, the more potential there is for more births. So there is another inflow arrow going in the other direction, too. Be apprised that inflows and outflows are often not in sync with each other, and when flows are out of balance, stocks can change. For instance, the rate of bugs incoming could easily exceed the rate at which they're being fixed.</p>\n<h3><strong>Stocks respond to changes in flow slowly</strong></h3>\n<p>When flows change, stocks tend to be a lagging indicator of that change. Stocks have a momentum, and tend to either grow or shrink. A change in the flows can only go so fast. Even if a radical change in the flows happens, it may take time for the stock to reflect that change in any meaningful way, especially if a stock is being fed from multiple flows at once. Having an awareness of what causes flows to change can serve as an early indicator for stock shifts.</p>\n<h2>Feedback Loops</h2>\n<p>Feedback loops are flow of causal connections that a stock is dependent on. Often feedback loops are flows of information about a stock that leads to a decision that influences the stock. Simply put, it's a cause-and-effect loop. Feedback loops come in several flavors depending on the behavior that they exhibit.</p>\n<p>A <strong>reinforcing feedback</strong> <strong>loop</strong> is one that creates more of a stock. It amplifies a signal. The more adoption there is of a design system in an organization, the more people advocate for its merits, and in turn the more adoption it gets. Likewise, the more attrition there is in an org, the lower the morale is, the more people leave, and so on. Reinforcing feedback loops are self-perpetuating. Unchecked, these loops can lead to exponential growth or collapse. This can be either good or bad depending on which behavior the loop is reinforcing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"reinforcingloop-f82145d2-61f4-4049-8803-c16c27b501b7.svg\" alt=\"Reinforcing loop diagram\" title=\"Reinforcing Loop\"></p>\n<p>A <strong>balancing feedback loop</strong> is one that neutralizes or balances out whatever flow is imposed on it. Balancing feedback loops are inherently goal seeking - which means that they always have a desired state they want to be in and seek to bring the system into that desirable range. Take a cup of coffee for instance. What the coffee wants, the coffee's goal, is to be the same temperature as the room it sits in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"frame-c1ae4280-724c-47b1-8ad1-573ab0d10d04.svg\" alt=\"Balancing loop diagram\" title=\"Balancing Loop\"></p>\n<p>The greater the discrepancy between a balancing loop's goal and the actual level, the faster it moves toward that goal. So in our coffee example, the hotter the coffee, or the colder the room, the faster the coffee will cool.</p>\n<h3><strong>Feedback loops aren't equal strength</strong></h3>\n<p>When you're dealing with multiple feedback loops, most of the time one loop is more dominant than the other. Sometimes these relationships can change over time, causing dominance relationships to shift. What's interesting to look at here is what the driving factors are between shifts in flows. Identifying these shift points and the factors that influence them can help you spot when a change in the system might be coming, and can help you prepare for it.</p>\n<h2>Delay</h2>\n<p>Delays are exactly what they sound like: information not getting its message back into the system in a timely enough manner to affect change in the preferred way. There are more than likely delays in every feedback loop you encounter. They could be as short as minutes and as long as months of even years. Let's save a few words and look at a diagram that shows how delays impact feedback:</p>\n<p><img src=\"delays-835ab793-bc15-4352-ac8b-3e4b70c7201e.svg\" alt=\"Delay diagram\" title=\"Delay diagram\"></p>\n<p>In the example above, a symptom of a larger system problem arises, and a short-term stopgap solution is implemented, which alleviates the system problem. However, a delay exists (shown as a double bar through a flow) between when a fix is issued and the downstream unintended consequences of that change that cause the issue or similar ones to come back. Strictly speaking, this diagram could have more delays that would impact timing. There could (and almost certainly would, let's be honest) be a delay between when a system problem was identified and when a solution was decided and implemented. The larger these delays are in a balancing loop, the greater the discrepancy between the inflow and outflow for that stock.</p>\n<h2>Resilience</h2>\n<p>Resilience is a measure of a system's ability to respond and adapt to changing conditions over time. When a sudden shock happens, are the systems that we've designed ready to absorb a deviation and still accomplish the same goals?</p>\n<p>Too often, the systems we are trying to build and maintain are too optimized for delivery. While this might have ensured we're being as efficient as possible with our time and energy, it also means we might not have managed enough for when shit hits the fan. This is often because the systems we design typically only really account for linear, incremental change. We don't take into account the possibility that radical, revolutionary change will happen. <strong>Optimization and resilience are always in a state of tension</strong>, because the more we optimize highly complex design systems for a particular workflow goaled around delivery within a given set of organizational structure and design patterns, the less resilient those systems become.</p>\n<h2>How do systems tend to behave?</h2>\n<p>Now that we have a basic set of vocabulary we can really get started. The great thing about systems thinking is that similarly modeled systems tend to exhibit similar patterns of behavior, too. Bearing that in mind, let's talk through a few principles that tend to underpin systems.</p>\n<h3><strong>The most important input into a system is the one that's the most limiting</strong></h3>\n<p>Knowing which aspect of a design system is the limiting factor is somewhat tricky. Depending on how the design system is maintained, it could be more or less related to staffing or time allocation for the maintainers. Identifying which aspects of your team structure have the greatest impact on your ability to control the health of your design system will help you understand where to put your effort. A dip in these resources can also serve as an early warning sign of systemic problems. A tree without sunlight won't grow, no matter how healthy its roots are. If there's no one around to maintain a design system, it doesn't matter how complete it is: it will slowly wilt.</p>\n<h3><strong>The changing aspects of a system are the ones that have the least effect on the system as a whole</strong></h3>\n<p>Changing out the total set of components in a design system does not have much effect on whether or not it <em>is</em> a system. It might not even have much of an affect on how the system is maintained. Likewise, changing the maintainers of that system doesn't really change whether or not there is a design system. The aspects of the system that are constantly in flux don't tend to be the parts of the system that have a major impact on the system as a whole.</p>\n<h3><strong>Reinforcing feedback loops emerge whenever the system can reproduce itself</strong></h3>\n<p>If the system has a way to create self-perpetuating behavior, you have a reinforcing feedback loop. The greater the adoption of your design system across the company, the easier it is for others to adopt it too, so the more they do, ad infinitum. The opposite is also true — the less adopted your system is, the less incentive there is to adopt, the more people diverge from the system, and the less overall adoption it has as a result. If stability is your aim, reinforcing loops need a balancing loop to bring the system back into equilibrium. Often this won't just be a single loop, but a set of many loops all working together.</p>\n<h3><strong>Oscillations are caused by delays in feedback loops</strong></h3>\n<p>Oscillations occur when decisions that impact inflows and outflows are made with incomplete information due to delays in feedback loops. Oscillations and delays create an unnecessary lack of stability in a system. A wild oscillation can cause overshoots in stocks, while large delays can cause a total collapse of a stock. You can determine which delays are important to focus on by understanding which oscillations most affect the system goals and then monitoring the delays that cause those oscillations</p>\n<h3><strong>People make decisions based off of bounded rationality</strong></h3>\n<p>This idea, coined by economist Herbert Simon, states that people tend to make the best decisions they can with the information they had available to them at the time. But nobody has complete information, especially in a complex system. And our biases impact our ability to make rational decisions even with the information that we do have. That being said, if we know bounded rationality exists, we can plan and account for it by getting the right information to the right place at the right time so that each individual part of the system acts in a way that builds up a pattern of behavior that's beneficial to the system as a whole.</p>\n<h2>Archetypical Problems in Systems</h2>\n<p>System archetypes are behavioral scenarios common across many systems.These are some of the patterns that may be common to experience in design systems, though there are <a href=\"https://thesystemsthinker.com/applying-systems-archetypes/\">several others</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Eroding goals / drifting performance</strong></h3>\n<p>When some aspect of the system fails to reach its goals, it sets subsequent goals lower and lower over time. In subsystems, this has a ripple effect throughout the entire system. A team might start with a goal of having 100% compliance with a design system and then misses that goal. The next time around, it slowly erodes to 80%, then 60%, and so on. People tend to focus on the negative - so missing their goals by a little feels worse than how good they would have felt if they had reached their goals easily. Common excuses emerge to justify the eroding goals. \"What did you expect\" or \"Nobody is perfect\" or \"We can't be too hard on ourselves here\". To fight this, don't let up on your goals, no matter what the performance is. Try to instill a reinforcing feedback loop that works to counter the eroding goals by championing wins. That will invert perceptions so that folks are incentivized to work harder and harder the better things get rather than focusing on working less and less when things go wrong.</p>\n<h3><strong>Growth Limits</strong></h3>\n<p>Subsystems may eventually run into resource limits that prevent it from further growth, even if it hasn't yet reached its goal. You might have a goal of 100% adoption, but can't seem to provide enough support to individual teams to empower the last 10% of people to finally adopt. You can avoid these limits to growth by examining growth loops and identifying potential limitations to that growth before the system runs up against them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Seeking the wrong goal</strong></h3>\n<p>If the goal you're seeking isn't well defined, or isn't properly measured, it's possible that your system will be optimized to realize an outcome that's more in line with what you measured, rather than what you expected. There's that old Eisner quote — “Not everything important is measurable, and not everything measurable is important.” If your incentives are based on quantity, you might end up with <em>growth</em>, but not <em>progress</em>. Focus on clarifying what your goals and vision for the system are <strong>before</strong> asking others to act on it.</p>\n<h2>How can we use our knowledge of systems to build better design systems?</h2>\n<h3><strong>Create a model of the system</strong></h3>\n<p>A model of a design system will be different for every organization. They'll be impacted by the teams that manage them, the complexity of the system and the applications it needs to support, the programs and support that underpins that system, and the processes and feedback loops that grow and shrink that system. There will be delays in feedback loops that impact the system's ability to respond to business change. Understanding this model and the goals of the system can expose opportunities to restructure the system to better align goals and influence a set of behaviors.</p>\n<h3><strong>Understand your system's paradigms</strong></h3>\n<p>Paradigms are the things that goals and structure emerge from. What does your culture consider to be the source of truth for a design system — the code or the design assets? Structures, goals, rules, and feedback loops will be dramatically different depending on where your organization stands on this issue. While it's not easy to change paradigms on a societal or cultural level quickly, it's important to know what game you're playing. Understanding these paradigms also gives your team an opportunity to buck convention in search of a model that transcends the status quo.</p>\n<h3><strong>Understand how information flows through the system</strong></h3>\n<p>The lack of information in a feedback loop, or delays that prevent people from getting the information they need to make informed decisions that impact the system can be one of the biggest factors causing a system to perform below our expectations. By providing the right kind of information to people who need it, it's easier to increase accountability. Often a failure to keep feedback loops between subsystems open is how this breaks down. This can lead to a Prisoner's Dilemma, where failure to cooperate leads to a worse outcome, even when the cost of cooperating (maintaining that feedback loop) seems expensive. Plan out how information will flow through your system and what type of delays you expect to have as a result. Identify where oscillations could occur.</p>\n<h3><strong>Publish the rules for self-organization</strong></h3>\n<p>Systems that have ways to allow subsystems to adjust in light of new conditions are better equipped to weather storms that ones that go through larger, more complex parent systems. By publishing a set of rules that outline exactly when, how, and what system can modify or extend can help teams evolve in ways that aren't detrimental to the whole. Rather than creating a complex structure of rules and decision points, create simple rules that are broadly applicable across lots of other subsystems and teams that everyone can learn and internalize.</p>\n<h3><strong>Examine \"What If\" scenarios</strong></h3>\n<p>Once we have a good understanding of the structure of a system and the relative strength of feedback loops in that system, we can start to model hypothetical scenarios that can predict what would happen under certain conditions. This can help us understand how to focus our efforts on what will affect the most positive change or where we need to focus on mitigating a risk.</p>\n<h3><strong>Create stable, independent, hierarchical subassemblies</strong></h3>\n<p>The best functioning systems are the ones that have subsystems capable of regulating and maintaining themselves independently while still serving the needs of a larger system. Hierarchy of subsystems can create larger systems that are more resilient and naturally stable. Identify which aspects of your system can operate independently and reduce dependencies. Next, identify where subsystems can ladder up to larger goals.</p>\n<p>When lower level system goals dominate or work in opposition to the goals of the larger system, a loop arises that damages the overall system and contributes to instability. Likewise, when the highest levels of the system exert too much control on individual subsystems, those subsystems are less resilient to changes. To achieve the most stable hierarchy, balance responsibilities between subsystems and the overall system to make them more resilient.</p>\n<h3><strong>When long delays are present, act early</strong></h3>\n<p>Long delays lead to system oscillations, so when delays are very long, don't wait for the problem to become obvious before making some corrective action. If you're waiting for a measurement that is attached to a long delay, you'll often make decisions too late. Act early so you have time to correct for new information when it finally does arrive. Build longer testing periods into the process of building and releasing new components. Make it easy for people to provide feedback quickly.</p>\n<h3><strong>If the bounded rationality of any part of the system isn't working, restructure it</strong></h3>\n<p>If people in the system don't have the right information, goals, or incentives to create the desired behavior for the overall system, then it isn't the fault of those people — the system itself isn't setting them up for success. Put new processes in place that facilitate a better flow of information so each person is better informed and can make decisions that benefit the system as a whole. Focus on delivering <strong><em>timely, complete information</em></strong> to the people whose decisions are most impacted by that information.</p>\n<p>We can build more resilient design systems by improving the feedback loops between decision makers and planning for a \"margin of error\" in a design system that allows for certain drifts in the system that are easily correctable. We can also increase tolerance by increasing modularity and keeping a loose coupling between as many parts of the system as possible.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The thing about design systems is that they live inside of extremely complex organizations. Every design system operates inside of a little kingdom, and both the design of that system and the people who live inside of it every day are under constant change. That's what makes design systems at once so exciting and so difficult to design and maintain. I hope that this article gives you another perspective about how to think about design systems within the larger context of that living, breathing world.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in learning more about system dynamics and systems analysis, I highly recommend the following additional reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557\">Thinking in Systems, A Primer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050912000130\">A Framework for Resilience Thinking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thesystemsthinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Introduction-to-Systems-Thinking-IMS013Epk.pdf\">Introduction to Systems Thinking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thesystemsthinker.com/\">The Systems Thinker</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-70567f8cff9559d2f7800cd3d033690a-gatsby-remark-prismjs-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Which Shade of Gray Should I Use For Disabled States\ndate: 2016-10-10","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":4,"offset":84},"indent":[1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The web is an accessibility nightmare.

But here's what I do know: <strong>WCAG doesn't set contrast requirements for disabled text</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Incidental</strong> – Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component,\nthat are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone,\nor that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.\n– <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html\"><em>From WCAG 2.0</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Default, unstyled HTML button labels set to <code class=\"language-text\">disabled</code> are <code class=\"language-text\">#7F7F7F</code>. This is a <code class=\"language-text\">4:1</code> contrast ratio on a white background, just slightly off from minimum. This comes close to meeting the standard for low vision and moderately low visual acuity that tends to come with age. This is around 20/40 vision and tends to represent the acuity of a user around age 80 years old. This would be fine if the text was over 18pt or was 14 point bold.</p>\n<p>Default, unstyled radio buttons set to <code class=\"language-text\">disabled</code> have borders of <code class=\"language-text\">#D8D8D8</code>. This is a 1.43:1 ratio, which is pretty terrible.</p>\n<p>Disabled, checked checkboxes have the checkmark at <code class=\"language-text\">#A1A1A1</code>. This is a <code class=\"language-text\">2.58:1</code> ratio. Still bad, but getting better.</p>\n<p>Pretty dismal as far as options go. Just because WCAG AA doesn't specify a minimum, doesn't mean we can't adopt some sensible best practices for disabled text:</p>\n<h3>Best Practices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave disabled form elements at their default styles, even though they don't meet WCAG A.</li>\n<li>But set the disabled label color to no darker than <code class=\"language-text\">#7F7F7F</code> to ensure that while the button isn't visible, the identifying label is still readable for most. This will serve as a clue for most users.</li>\n<li>Disable any visual styling on hover or click for disabled buttons or text to prevent confusion</li>\n<li>Consider some hint text, either in a tooltip or copy next to the disabled action instructing the user on why the action is disabled.</li>\n<li>Keep the contrast on regular, active items high so that the difference between active items and disabled items is still distinguishable at a glance.</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-59ce30f349a5c6effaf67e6d64a5d716-gatsby-remark-prismjs-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: The Map Is Not The Territory\ndate: 2017-09-15","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":4,"offset":60},"indent":[1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Design systems have done much in terms of advocating for and advancing collective thought towards the notion of component-based design and development strategy.

choosing fonts for web typography, it's easy for a designer to impulsively reach for Open Sans or Lato or Avenir or whatever the newest, hottest thing out there at the time is. I've done it. We all have. There's a compulsion for the fonts we use on the web to match the fonts we use in marketing material, particuarily print. After all - we do want to be <em>on brand</em>, right? But is that the most important thing typography should address?</p>\n<p>But if you start to consider your performance budget, using webfonts starts to make less and less sense. <a href=\"http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2010/09/07/429014/200875/en/New-Survey-From-Compuware-Gomez-Reveals-Consumers-Will-Quickly-Abandon-Slow-Websites.html\">Users hate slow websites</a></p>\n<h4>We need to consider what typography is <em>for</em> and what problem it aims to <em>solve</em>.</h4>\n<p>Let's pay attention to the words we don't often even bother to look up in the dictionary. Take user <em>interfaces</em> for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>in·ter·face</h4>\n<p>ˈin(t)ərˌfās - <strong>noun</strong><br>\n⁣1. a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc., meet and interact.<br>\n⁣ 2. a device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer.<br>\n⁣ – <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=interface+definition&#x26;oq=interface+definition\"><em>From Google</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>When I design something, I aim to make every single design decision solve a problem.</h3>\n<p>Sometimes that problem is for the user, like increasing legibility or reducing cognitive load. Sometimes the problem is for the business, like increasing maintainability and scalability. So maybe that means adding constraints to the design requirements and increasing the efficiency of the system.</p>\n<h2>If typography in an interface exists to facilitate interaction, putting a webfont in a button or other parts of UI copy does little to advance this cause.</h2>\n<p>But what it does do is this: make your page heavier and harder to maintain. Good web typography should be functional and performant. Everything beyond that is nice to have and should be considered an optimization on an already validated design.</p>\n<h2>Using system fonts allows designers to focus more on solving problems and less on aesthetics.</h2>\n<p>They also allow your site to feel native to the platform in which a user is experiencing it.\n<a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jul/0169.html\">W3C is already considering this as a standard anyway</a></p>\n<p>If you must include webfonts as a part of your UI, at least consider the <a href=\"http://cognition.happycog.com/article/7-alternatives-to-popular-web-typefaces-for-better-performance\">alternatives</a> that might help reduce your page to help reduce weight and load them <a href=\"https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver\">in the most efficient way you can.</a></p>\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bramstein.com/writing/\">Bram Stein on loading fonts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/\">Marcin Wichary on Using System UI Fonts in Web Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mrmrs/awesome-system-fonts\">Sites with System Fonts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cognition.happycog.com/article/designing-with-a-performance-budget\">Katie Kovalcin on Designing wtih a Performance Budget</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-ast-59ce30f349a5c6effaf67e6d64a5d716-gatsby-remark-prismjs-","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Design systems have done much in terms of advocating for and advancing collective thought towards the notion of component-based design and development strategy.
