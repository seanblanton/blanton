fact that this post is incomplete and represents only my limited knowledge of systems analysis. The ideas I present here might be skewed and in some cases, rather abstract. This is partly because if I were to put these concepts into more concrete forms they lose a kind of universality that this article seeks to outline.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">I also recognize that this way of modeling systems assumes certain organizational structures exist inside a company that can support this methodology. This includes not only the mechanisms to collect data about the system behavior, but a team (or teams) with the time to dedicate toward understanding the behavior of the design, product, and engineering teams using the design system. It also assumes that these organizations are at a level of scale and complexity large enough to warrant even <strong><em>worrying</em></strong> about this type of thing. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that the costs outweigh the benefits for smaller organizations, specifically because so much of what this article discusses is already sort of tacitly understood by at least some people in the org. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t something to be gained by rising the ocean of understanding across the board.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">This article&#x27;s thrust is to outline the broad strokes of systems analysis and how it relates to design systems in a way that is helpful without having to go full boar into complex system modeling or theories that aren&#x27;t immediately applicable to a design organization. While it&#x27;s all very fascinating, there just isn&#x27;t enough space in this article to dedicate to going into the nuance. It&#x27;s my hope instead that this article inspire teams to have rigorous discussions about how their design system structure is influencing behavior, and identify ways to use design systems better to reach their goals.</div><style data-emotion="css 1ojaszx">.css-1ojaszx{font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:600;line-height:1.15;padding-top:1.25rem;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}</style><h2 class="css-1ojaszx">Designing Design Systems</h2><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx"><em>TLDR: Systems give us a better understanding of the how complex, interconnected, nonlinear parts behave.

Fabulous. As the overall complexity of that design system grows over time, it will become more and more necessary to get a better handle on exactly what the hell people are doing with it. Are your design systems actually effective at solving problems? Are you actually reaching the goals you set out to achieve? And just what are those goals, anyway? Is it to build faster and more consistently — or is that really just more of a rule or requirement you need to fulfill in order to keep the thing standing up in the first place?</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">All of these questions are tied up in the operational complexity of whatever organization your design system aims to serve. It could be a team or 5 for an individual surface or a team of 500. It doesn&#x27;t really matter - at some point it becomes difficult to make improvements to how your design system operates without having a baseline to measure from — to have some indication one way or another if your design system is trending the organization toward its larger goal. We can&#x27;t predict the future, but we can envision it, and the greater understanding we have of the world in which our design system sits and the behavior of the people who act upon it, the better decisions we can make about how to structure it, communicate it, and scale it so that it provides the most value and the least stress.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Once we understand how the system is structured and how it behaves, we can shift from asking questions like &quot;Is it okay for dialogs to be scrollable?&quot; and instead spending more of our time asking questions like &quot;What role should design systems play in improving product quality?&quot;. These types of questions have longer lasting, broader impact than any single event or pattern of events could because they&#x27;re necessarily future-oriented.

They are educational programs and support networks, bug reporting channels, experimental projects, and so on. And there are actors in that system that will do things with that design system that we might not expect. Our ability to recognize and respond to behaviors we don&#x27;t expect can impact our ability to design design systems that are resilient - systems that can grow and evolve as the company, its goals, and the people who are a part of it grow and evolve.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">I&#x27;ll be exploring these ideas through the lens of system analysis, which is a branch of systems theory. This was all highly inspired by a book called <style data-emotion="css 68qlq5">.css-68qlq5{display:inline;cursor:pointer;}.css-68qlq5 a:hover{-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}</style><span class="css-68qlq5"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557" target="_blank">Thinking in Systems</a></span> from Donella Meadows. That book is an excellent crash course into systems theory. And many of the examples I&#x27;ll use to explain some basic concepts of systems are pulled from that work or others like it. Not all my examples are directly related to design — and that&#x27;s okay. Where possible, I will illustrate concepts by using simple systems with which we are all already familiar.</div><style data-emotion="css 1ojaszx">.css-1ojaszx{font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:600;line-height:1.15;padding-top:1.25rem;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}</style><h2 class="css-1ojaszx">What is systems theory and how can it help design systems?</h2><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">A system is a collection of <strong>interconnected</strong>, organized elements that work together to produce patterns of behavior over time. E.g. A highway is a system of roads and signs and ramps organized for the purpose of maximizing efficient travel. Systems can be embedded inside of systems, so a traffic light is a subsystem within that larger road system. The individual traffic lights go on and off in a specific order and pattern that we can model. The signal&#x27;s individual behavior acts on the larger roadway and the people that use those roads. The fact that they are a system isn&#x27;t the interesting part — the interesting part comes into play when we understand how those individual parts of the system work together to do something meaningful. e.g. How does the addition or subtraction of a single traffic light effect congestion? We encounter all kinds of systems on a daily basis, we just don&#x27;t often think of them as such. Every person you&#x27;ve ever met is a system of hundreds of little tiny systems all working together to help us breathe and eat and go about our days.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Systems theory is the study of how systems are structured and why they do whatever it is they do by understanding their parts, relationships, and behaviors that emerge from them. If we can model a system, we can use that model to gain another perspective that can help us identify root causes to problems and in turn make better decisions. We can expose the model to rigor. We can find the places where it breaks down or find critical relationships that aren&#x27;t immediately obvious.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">One of the fundamental flaws with systems analysis is that a model of a system is just that - it&#x27;s only a model, and that model is going to be imperfect. Often, the world in which these models live and breath is a curving set French curves of relationships that swirl and bend back on themselves in complicated ways. They are dynamic and experience perturbations we never expected and can&#x27;t account for, but the better we understand a system&#x27;s structure at its basic level, the more equipped we are to understand it at its most complex.</div><style data-emotion="css 1ojaszx">.css-1ojaszx{font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:600;line-height:1.15;padding-top:1.25rem;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}</style><h2 class="css-1ojaszx">Parts of a system</h2><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Not everything is a system, mind you. That pile of junk in my filing cabinet drawer - not a system, no matter how much I might try to convince you that it&#x27;s an &quot;<em>organized mess</em>&quot;. There are a collection of elements, sure, but they are neither connected to one another nor are they in a state of change. Nothing acts on them and they don&#x27;t cause anything else to change, either. Systems have a common set of identifiable elements we can model and a set of behaviors acting on that system. Let&#x27;s get a little glossary going so we don&#x27;t have to fuss with what all these things mean as we get going. If you are already familiar with systems theory, you might find some of these explanations fairly reductive, but it&#x27;ll give us some common ground to work our way up from:</div><style data-emotion="css 1ojaszx">.css-1ojaszx{font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:600;line-height:1.15;padding-top:1.25rem;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}</style><h2 class="css-1ojaszx">Stocks</h2><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Okay, so stocks are the quantifiable <em>stuff</em> of a system, the <em>inventory</em> or <em>goods (</em>though they don&#x27;t need to be physical.

Stocks in a design system might be the number of designers, engineers, and content strategists your design system is consumed by. It&#x27;s the org budget, the headcount. It&#x27;s also the number of people maintaining the system, the number of components, the footprint of products it supports, the amount of time available in a given week to maintain it, and so on.</div><style data-emotion="css 1jmkgpr">.css-1jmkgpr{font-size:1rem;font-weight:700;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:0.3125rem;}</style><h3 class="css-1jmkgpr"><strong>We tend to focus more on stocks than flows</strong></h3><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">When considering design systems, we often over-index on the volume of our stocks, e.g. the number of components in the design system, for instance, and underweight the value in managing the flows that feed those systems.

Flows can either be inflows, actions which cause a stock to increase, or outflows, which cause a stock to decrease. Once we have a single flow and two stocks, we have the beginning of a relationship in that system. For example: the more births there are, the more the population increases. There is an inflow relationship between births and population. But there&#x27;s more going on here, too — the greater the population, the more potential there is for more births. So there is another inflow arrow going in the other direction, too. Be apprised that inflows and outflows are often not in sync with each other, and when flows are out of balance, stocks can change. For instance, the rate of bugs incoming could easily exceed the rate at which they&#x27;re being fixed.</div><style data-emotion="css 1jmkgpr">.css-1jmkgpr{font-size:1rem;font-weight:700;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:0.3125rem;}</style><h3 class="css-1jmkgpr"><strong>Stocks respond to changes in flow slowly</strong></h3><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">When flows change, stocks tend to be a lagging indicator of that change.

Flows can either be inflows, actions which cause a stock to increase, or outflows, which cause a stock to decrease. Once we have a single flow and two stocks, we have the beginning of a relationship in that system. For example: the more births there are, the more the population increases. There is an inflow relationship between births and population. But there\u0026#x27;s more going on here, too — the greater the population, the more potential there is for more births. So there is another inflow arrow going in the other direction, too. Be apprised that inflows and outflows are often not in sync with each other, and when flows are out of balance, stocks can change. For instance, the rate of bugs incoming could easily exceed the rate at which they\u0026#x27;re being fixed.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 1jmkgpr\"\u003e.css-1jmkgpr{font-size:1rem;font-weight:700;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:0.3125rem;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"css-1jmkgpr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStocks respond to changes in flow slowly\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eWhen flows change, stocks tend to be a lagging indicator of that change.
