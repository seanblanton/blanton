Conversely, an object could exist at a relatively low state of complexity but have a cascading effect that has implications on many, \u003cem\u003emany other parts of the design system\u003c/em\u003e, thus giving it \u003cstrong\u003elarge mass\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eDesign systems can do a lot to keep the overall complexity of the system down by considering the parts before the whole. By prioritizing the parts of the design system which have the smallest size, but the greatest mass, it\u0026#x27;s easier to start building a design system that pays dividends. Likewise, when new objects come into existence, the question about whether or not to let new circumstances impact the momentum of the design system should also be a matter of the mass and size of that change relative to the current state of the overall system.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eThis is by no means a perfect way to build a design system. I recognize that the massive complexity of building at scale and parallel to ongoing product development efforts can strongly impact one\u0026#x27;s ability to always rationalize system adaptation against the notions of mass and size. At the end of the day, design systems are built for people, and we should be doing whatever we can to make their lives better, in both the short term and the long, and not let any guiding notions like these become dogmatic treatises any more than should the idea that these systems are winding and complex and cannot be neatly put into boxes mock the attempt.\u003c/div\u003e","scope":{}},"frontMatter":{"title":"Size and Mass in Design Systems","date":"16 September 2017","excerpt":"Determining the complexity of a system component by its goals and relationship to its users."}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["2017","size-and-mass-in-design-systems"]},"buildId":"Mds6s_rqhXuzAkjtH4vvs","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-2473c6643d514137e5d1.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-c19f382b0bb0b715446f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-95c2b224bccf352ee870.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.76fac10824b6450d7d51.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.fd0298556b6c9781b52e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/dcc0a1fa35ca3b603b3e8463990eb80974b53013.2c28760ea9129689f3b0.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-d846102840a230597995.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/44957b46d6ac904e0d4793d3ea4fc10a729efb13.42124a1a37c5ff0266ea.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/blog/%5B...slug%5D-b5de13491e23c4288ecc.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Mds6s_rqhXuzAkjtH4vvs/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Mds6s_rqhXuzAkjtH4vvs/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
