For a thing to exist, it must exist at a particular point and place in time. Design systems describe not objects, but \u003cem\u003epossible\u003c/em\u003e objects, stripped down and generalized, and do not necessarily reference the relation of an object to its environment. These generalized concepts are things that cannot be fully described until the moment in which they exist again. Only though the application of a pattern in a particular situation can we truly say whether or not that pattern is a well-executed application of a system. The application of most parts of a design system are esoteric, and can only be described though metaphor.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eDesign system are not rigid rules to be followed. They’re more like sketches, gesture drawings that suggest a shape, a texture, a quality. They are the \u003cem\u003emap\u003c/em\u003e. They help guide us towards the right reality, but they are not in and of themselves \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e reality. So it seems that the best way to describe a design system is spend an equal amount of time not just documenting any given object, but documenting the \u003cem\u003eapplication\u003c/em\u003e of that object in time and space and in concert with all the objects it interacts with. But this is still not the territory. If we go through the process of naming and describing and cataloging a portion of the interface with the intent that the end result is a perfect depiction of the territory of that which it represents, we cannot ever reach objective truth. Any description of any interface would be done with a specifically chosen taxonomy to describe and account for that interface, and the very act of choosing \u003cem\u003ewhat\u003c/em\u003e to say is also a choice of what \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e to say. We can then look at that map and ask ourselves “what does this map represent?” and thus, we only make another map. Again and again, on and on.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eDesign systems should aim to tell \u003cstrong\u003estories\u003c/strong\u003e, organized through \u003cstrong\u003epatterns\u003c/strong\u003e, which set up scenarios and suggested outcomes. Throughout the description of these patterns, the design system will reference other patterns. Some of these patterns may be more or less gestural than others. When a design that utilizes that design system is being iterated upon, the system should serve as a guide towards more consistent outcomes. When the design is finalized, if a real pattern or object cannot be well-described through a design system, then either the object or the system should be modified to be rationalized through the order of the system, carefully minding that the design system not grow to such immense precision that it reaches an unusable size. I believe this is how design systems can be malleable to new ideas without becoming a tome of prescriptive specificity that everyone dreads.\u003c/div\u003e","scope":{}},"frontMatter":{"title":"The Map Is Not The Territory","date":"14 September 2017","excerpt":"How can design systems guide teams in the right direction and remain flexible at the same time?"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[...slug]","query":{"slug":["2017","the-map-is-not-the-territory"]},"buildId":"Mds6s_rqhXuzAkjtH4vvs","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-2473c6643d514137e5d1.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-c19f382b0bb0b715446f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-95c2b224bccf352ee870.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.76fac10824b6450d7d51.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.fd0298556b6c9781b52e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/dcc0a1fa35ca3b603b3e8463990eb80974b53013.2c28760ea9129689f3b0.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-d846102840a230597995.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/44957b46d6ac904e0d4793d3ea4fc10a729efb13.42124a1a37c5ff0266ea.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/blog/%5B...slug%5D-b5de13491e23c4288ecc.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Mds6s_rqhXuzAkjtH4vvs/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/Mds6s_rqhXuzAkjtH4vvs/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
