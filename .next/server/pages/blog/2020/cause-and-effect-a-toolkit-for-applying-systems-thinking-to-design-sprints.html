Yellowstone you might have heard. Throughout the early days of Yellowstone Park, wolves were considered a nuisance, as they were thought to be a threat to local livestock, and as a result, weren&#x27;t legally protected from being hunted. In 1907 political pressure from local ranchers and agricultural interests led to the USFS working with the United States Department of Agriculture Division of Biological Survey to develop methods for controlling wolves and coyotes.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Between 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in the park. By 1926, grey wolves were considered to be locally extinct. And after the wolves were gone, the elk population began to rise and overgraze on aspen, cottonwood, and berry producing shrubs. The loss of these plants led to a decline in beaver populations, too, as they depend on these plants to survive in the wintertime. Scientists began to worry about the negative effect as early as the 1930s.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Throughout the 1960s and 1970s (but as far back as the 1940s) wildlife biologists began to call for reintroducing wolves to the park, and finally, in March of 1995, fourteen wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone. The resulting change has been magnificent. In the years that followed, not only have the elk populations decreased, but the coyote population has too. Coyotes hunt foxes, so this decrease in the coyote population led to an increase in the fox population, which in turn increased the survival rate of other coyote prey, such as hares, rodents, and birds. The changes in these populations then altered the rate at which nuts, seeds, and insects were eaten. The changing grazing patterns of elks caused vegetation to recover. The number of beavers increased and created dams, which helped protect the streams and ponds against bank erosion and provided new habitats for moose and and fish. The songbirds came back.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Ecologists call this a “trophic cascade”. It’s a phenomenon where the act of adding or removing a top predator from the food chain causes a dramatic change in the food chain of the ecosystem as a whole. At Yellowstone, the reintroduction of a top predator caused the entire watershed to become not just more ecologically diverse, but more stable, too.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">The ecosystem that drives Yellowstone is a complex set of cascading actions and their consequences. This cascading effect exists far outside of ecology though. A change in just one aspect of any complex system can have an outsized effect on the whole. And the more we understand this chain of cause and effect, the better equipped we are to make decisions about how to change it for the better.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">About a year ago I wrote an overview of system dynamics and its application on design systems, largely based on the work of Donella Meadows. Today I’d like to build on that work by discussing how you can model systems to help you understand where you need to focus to have the most impact. Much of the concepts and ideas I’ll outline in this system + design workshop format are inspired by Rob Ricigliano.</div><style data-emotion="css 1ojaszx">.css-1ojaszx{font-size:1.5rem;font-weight:600;line-height:1.15;padding-top:1.25rem;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}</style><h2 class="css-1ojaszx">Who Is This For?</h2><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Systems thinking is a hot topic in product design right now, but let’s be very clear: not every problem can be solved with a system frame of mind. Problems that are well defined, well scoped, and focus on short-term progress probably won’t benefit from the kind of concentrated analysis that systems practices require to be executed successfully. Those types of problems are excellent for classic design sprints. I won’t go into detail about that here, but there’s a wealth of knowledge out there about design sprints. I recommend GV’s book Sprint.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Systems practice is better suited for folks looking to make significant change on a broad scale.

You likely won’t be able to solve all your problems at once, but knowing your ultimate goals can direct your short term focus to be in service of that larger term goal. Think about this with your Core Team and come up with a succinct statement to represent what you’re actually driving toward. This is often called a North Star vision.</div><style data-emotion="css 8ufjxx">.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}</style><div class="css-8ufjxx">Your North Star should have a few qualities:</div><style data-emotion="css 1cpkedc">.css-1cpkedc{margin-bottom:1.875rem;}</style><ol class="css-1cpkedc"><style data-emotion="css 1i1xeis">.css-1i1xeis{line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:0.625rem;}</style><li class="css-1i1xeis"><strong>It should be inspiring.</strong> Often, this north star is the root of your story.

In my opinion, this is the most important part of any long term strategy.</li><li class="css-1i1xeis"><strong>It should be human-centered.</strong> Now is not the time to worry about metrics.

Throughout the early days of Yellowstone Park, wolves were considered a nuisance, as they were thought to be a threat to local livestock, and as a result, weren\u0026#x27;t legally protected from being hunted. In 1907 political pressure from local ranchers and agricultural interests led to the USFS working with the United States Department of Agriculture Division of Biological Survey to develop methods for controlling wolves and coyotes.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eBetween 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in the park. By 1926, grey wolves were considered to be locally extinct. And after the wolves were gone, the elk population began to rise and overgraze on aspen, cottonwood, and berry producing shrubs. The loss of these plants led to a decline in beaver populations, too, as they depend on these plants to survive in the wintertime. Scientists began to worry about the negative effect as early as the 1930s.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eThroughout the 1960s and 1970s (but as far back as the 1940s) wildlife biologists began to call for reintroducing wolves to the park, and finally, in March of 1995, fourteen wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone. The resulting change has been magnificent. In the years that followed, not only have the elk populations decreased, but the coyote population has too. Coyotes hunt foxes, so this decrease in the coyote population led to an increase in the fox population, which in turn increased the survival rate of other coyote prey, such as hares, rodents, and birds. The changes in these populations then altered the rate at which nuts, seeds, and insects were eaten. The changing grazing patterns of elks caused vegetation to recover. The number of beavers increased and created dams, which helped protect the streams and ponds against bank erosion and provided new habitats for moose and and fish. The songbirds came back.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstyle data-emotion=\"css 8ufjxx\"\u003e.css-8ufjxx{font-size:1rem;font-weight:400;line-height:1.5;margin-bottom:1.875rem;}.css-8ufjxx a{font-weight:700;}\u003c/style\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"css-8ufjxx\"\u003eEcologists call this a “trophic cascade”.
